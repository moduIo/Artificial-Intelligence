HW1 is an implementation of a puzzle solver which uses heuristic searchs to solve instances of the 8 and 15 puzzle.  Specifically A*, IDA*, DLA* are all implemented.

HW2 is an implementation of a constraint solver which solves graph coloring problems using recursive best first search and min-conflicts algorithms.

HW3 is an NLP classifier for the Selected 20NewsGroup dataset which uses stemming and data preprocessing along with Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, and logistic regression to classify the data.
